## explain this code...

```
fn main() {
    // Confirm current working directory
    let cwd = env::current_dir();
    println!("The current directory is {}", cwd.unwrap().display());

    // Load the image file
    let filepath = "./src/source_image/happy_ferris.png".to_string();
    let image_obj: image::DynamicImage = image::open(filepath).unwrap();

    // Convert the image to a base64-encoded string
    let mut image_data: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
    image_obj
        .write_to(&mut Cursor::new(&mut image_data), ImageOutputFormat::Png)
        .unwrap();
    let res_base64 = base64::encode(image_data);
    print!("base64 output, ``{}``", res_base64)
}
```

This Rust code loads an image file, converts it to a base64-encoded string, and prints the resulting string.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of what the code does:

1. The code starts by confirming the current working directory using the __current_dir function from the __env__ module. The return value is an __io::Result<PathBuf>__ object, which represents either the current directory path or an error if the path cannot be determined. The __unwrap__ method is called on the result to extract the __PathBuf__ object, assuming that there will be no error.

2. The code then sets a variable __filepath__ to a string that contains the path to the image file that will be loaded.

3. The code uses the __open__ function from the __image__ module to load the image file specified by __filepath__. The __open__ function returns a __DynamicImage__ object, which represents the loaded image. The __unwrap__ method is called on the result to extract the __DynamicImage__ object, assuming that there will be no error.

4. The code creates an empty __Vec__ object __image_data__ to store the binary data of the image. The __write_to__ method is called on the __DynamicImage__ object to write the image data to a buffer. The buffer is created using the __Cursor__ type, which provides a seekable in-memory buffer. The __Png__ value is passed as the second argument to specify the image format for the output. The __unwrap__ method is called on the result to handle any errors.
5. The code then encodes the binary data stored in __image_data__ as a base64-encoded string using the __encode__ function from the __base64__ module. The resulting string is stored in a variable __res_base64__.

6. Finally, the code prints the base64-encoded string using the __print__ macro, which formats the string with the __{}__ placeholder and inserts the value of __res_base64__. The output is surrounded by backticks and double quotes for clarity.

Note that the __image__, __base64__, and __Cursor__ types are all imported through their respective modules at the beginning of the code. The __ImageOutputFormat__ type is also imported from the __image__ module.
