# Terms

Some terms that are common when talking about AI chatbots.

Goal: to share a sense of relationship/hierarchy of the terms AI, ML, and models (&NN).

## Prompts

- prompt: "in a few paragraphs for a 5th-grader, describe the relationship between artificial intelligence, machine-learning and language-models."

    - [link](ex_terms_AI_ML.html)

- prompt: "and how do neural networks fit into this -- again, for a 5th-grader?"

    - [link](ex_terms_NNs.html)

## Points...

- this process of refinement of questions shows why Google is so nervous (especially without ads!)
- we've just scratched the surface of an important aspect of ChatGPT -- the use of "personas", more about that soon after a bit of history.


## Relationship between AI & ML &NNs

- A Summary of the relationship of Artificial Intelligence to Machine Learning to Neural Networksâ€¦ One reasonable way to think of this: Neural-networks are a subfield/technique of Machine-Learning; Machine-Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence.

- maybe... __"does machine learning use models, or does it create models?"__
