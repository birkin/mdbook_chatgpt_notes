## write a biblical verse in the style of the king james bible explaining how to be patient when making a phone call to the department of motor-vehicles

Verily I say unto thee, when thou makest a phone call unto the department of motor-vehicles, thou must exercise patience, for the line may be long and the wait may be great.

Yea, though thou mayest be sorely tempted to raise thy voice and speak with anger, thou must instead speak with a gentle tongue and a humble heart.

For the workers at the department of motor-vehicles are but mortal beings, subject to the same frailties as thee, and they shall respond more kindly to thy soft words than to thy harsh ones.

And if thou remain steadfast in thy patience, lo, thou shalt surely reach the end of the line, and thy needs shall be met with efficiency and grace.

Therefore, let thy heart be calm, and thy tongue be measured, and thou shalt find favor in the sight of the Lord and in the eyes of those who serve thee.

## __"thx, but can you change that last paragraph not use the word "Lord"?"__

Certainly, here's the revised last paragraph:

Therefore, let thy heart be calm, and thy tongue be measured, and thou shalt find favor in the sight of all who serve thee, both in this life and the next. May your patience bring about the resolution you seek, and may you be rewarded for your perseverance.
