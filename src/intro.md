# Intro

Notes for ChatGPT presentation.

Contains rough outline and main points to make.

- ChatGPT -- what _is_ it?

    - the GPT stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer"
        - Generative -- it generates text
        - Pre-trained -- the model is pre-trained on a large corpus of text
        - Transformer -- the model uses the Transformer architecture

    - Ask chatGPT
        - "what is chatgpt?"
        - "in the context of machine-learning, what is a model?"
        - "does machine learning use models, or does it create models?"

    - On to terms...
