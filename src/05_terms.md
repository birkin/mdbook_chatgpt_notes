Some terms that are common when talking about AI chatbots.

## Model

__in the context of machine-learning, what is a 'model'?__

_In machine learning, a model is a mathematical representation or algorithm that learns patterns in data and can be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. A model is trained on a dataset and learns to recognize relationships and patterns in the data, which it can then use to make predictions or decisions about new data points. The goal of a model is to accurately generalize to new, unseen data, based on what it has learned from the training data._

__re-phrase that for a 14 year old.__

_In machine learning, a model is like a recipe that learns patterns from data. Just like you can use a recipe to make a cake, a model can make predictions or decisions based on what it has learned from the data it was trained on. The goal is for the model to be able to make accurate predictions or decisions on new data it hasn't seen before, just like how a good recipe can help you make a tasty cake every time.

## Relationship between AI & ML &NNs

The relationship of Artificial Intelligence to Machine Learning to Neural Networksâ€¦ One reasonable way to think of this: Neural-networks are a subfield/technique of Machine-Learning; Machine-Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence.

## Neural Network

__define neural networks in 50 words or less for a high-school student__

_Neural networks are a type of computer algorithm modeled after the way neurons in the human brain work. They consist of interconnected "nodes" that process and transmit information. Neural networks are used in many applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles. (ChatGPT, 2023-Feb-19)_

- The term "deep-learning" implies more complex neural networks trained on larger data-sets.

## Machine Learning ##

__define machine-learning in 50 words or less__

_Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence concerned with enabling computers to learn from data and improve on a specific task over time, without explicit programming. It involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to analyze data and make predictions or decisions. (ChatGPT, 2022-Dec)_

## Artificial Intelligence 

__define artificial intelligence__

_Artificial intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science focused on creating machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, problem solving, perception, and decision making. AI encompasses a wide range of techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision, and is used in many applications, from virtual assistants and self-driving cars to medical diagnosis and financial analysis. (ChatGPT, 2023-Feb-19)_

## Algorithm

__define algorithms__

_An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task, typically expressed as a set of instructions or rules that a computer can follow. Algorithms are used in many areas of computer science and beyond, such as machine learning, cryptography, data analysis, and mathematical optimization. The design and analysis of algorithms is an important area of research in computer science, aimed at creating efficient and effective solutions to complex problems. (ChatGPT, 2023-Feb-19)_
