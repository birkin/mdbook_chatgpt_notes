# Terms

Some terms that are common when talking about AI chatbots.

Goal: to share a sense of relationship/hierarchy of the terms AI, ML, and models (&NN).

## AI

__"What is "Artificial Intelligence"?"__ -- [link](http://localhost:3001/02a_terms_what-is-ai.html)

## ML

__"What is "Machine Learning"?"__ -- [link](http://localhost:3001/02b_terms_what-is-ml.html)

- __"describe machine learning in one or two paragraphs, first for a college sophomore, and second for a 14-year old.__ (same link as above)

## Models

__"in the context of machine-learning, what is a 'model'?"__ -- [link](http://localhost:3001/02b2_what-are-models.html)

- __"re-phrase that for a 14 year old."__  (same link as above)

- __"does machine learning use models, or does it create models?"__



## NNs

__"define neural networks in 50 words or less for a high-school student"__ -- [link](http://localhost:3001/02c_terms_what-are-nns.html)

- __"Where do "Neural Networks" fit into "Machine Learning"?"__  (same link as above)

- __"rephrase that last answer for a 14-year old."__ (same link as above)

- __"enhance that a bit into two or three paragraphs, still for a 14 year old."__ (same link as above)


## Points...

- we've just shown that ChatGPT has "memory" and a sense of context
- this process of refinement of questions shows why Google is so nervous (especially without ads!)
- in the ML & NN questions, we've just scratched the surface of an important aspect of ChatGPT -- the use of "personas", more about that soon after a bit of history.


## Relationship between AI & ML &NNs

- A Summary of the relationship of Artificial Intelligence to Machine Learning to Neural Networksâ€¦ One reasonable way to think of this: Neural-networks are a subfield/technique of Machine-Learning; Machine-Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence.

- maybe... __"does machine learning use models, or does it create models?"__
