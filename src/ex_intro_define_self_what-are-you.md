# what are you?

__"what is chatgpt?"__

I am ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI. I use artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques to understand and generate human-like responses to text-based queries. Essentially, I'm a computer program designed to chat with humans in a conversational manner. You can ask me questions, have a conversation with me, or even ask me to help you with tasks like writing or research.
