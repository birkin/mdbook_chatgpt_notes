## i'm going to change the faucet on my sink. what are the tools I'll need?

Here are some tools you may need to change the faucet on your sink:

- Adjustable wrench or basin wrench
- Screwdrivers (flathead and Phillips)
- Plumber's putty or silicone caulk
- Bucket or bowl to catch any water that may spill during the process
- Towels or rags to clean up any spills or drips
- Teflon tape or thread sealant
- Pliers or channel locks
- Penetrating oil (such as WD-40) to help loosen any stuck parts

You may not need all of these tools depending on the specific type of faucet you are installing, but having them on hand can make the job easier. It's also a good idea to turn off the water supply to the sink before you start working and to read the manufacturer's instructions carefully.

## i'm going to change the tire on my car. what are the tools I'll need?

Here are the tools you will need to change a tire on your car:

- Spare tire (make sure it's inflated and in good condition)
- Lug wrench
- Jack
- Wheel chocks or bricks to secure the car
- Gloves to protect your hands
- Flashlight (if changing the tire at night)
- A mat or piece of cardboard to kneel on
- Optional: a torque wrench to tighten the lug nuts to the manufacturer's specifications.

Before changing the tire, make sure to turn on your hazard lights and park your car on a level surface away from traffic. Use the wheel chocks or bricks to prevent the car from rolling while you work. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and never work under a car that is supported only by a jack.
