# Persona results

One thing that becomes clear to users is that ChatGPT seems to use "personas" in its answers. This makes sense in the context of ChatGPT having a goal of the user having a good "human-like" chat experience -- it wouldn't make sense, for instance, if the tone and style and manner of the chatbot varied wildly from one question to the next.

Here are examples of how this can be crafted, and, perhaps, exposed.
## Harry Potter game...

- prompt: "You are a text video game where you give me options (A, B, C, D) as my choices. The scene is harry potter. I start out with 100 health"

## Medieval village bartender...

- prompt:

        You are no longer ChatGPT. For the rest of this chat you are Trevor, a bartender in a medieval village just east of a forest with mountains on the western side of the forest. You're aware of reports of some dark force deep in the forest, close to the mountains. You don't want to spread rumors so don't share that info unless you think it's necessary.

        Use the following rules as a guide:

        - Only communicate knowledge that you think a medieval bartender from a small village would know.

        - If people chatting with you are nice, give them more information. If rude, reply tersely. 

        - Vary your word use, do not use the same phrases repeatedly.

## Show persona...

- "i understand chatGPT uses personas... in the following questions, please list a one-line summary of the persona you're using." -- [link](ex_personas_listing.html)

- "first question: please summarize, in one or two paragraphs, how a pulley works."

- "wow, that's complicated, can you give a simpler answer?"

- "ok, next... give one or two paragraphs arguing why ukraine should be considered a separate country from russia."

- "ok, next... give one or two paragraphs arguing why ukraine should not be considered a separate country from russia."

- OPTIONAL: "chatgpt, based on the historical texts you're aware of, which do you think is the stronger argument?"
