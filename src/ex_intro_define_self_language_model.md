__"when you say "language model", what is that?"__

A language model is a type of artificial intelligence system that is designed to understand and generate human language. Specifically, a language model is a computer program that is trained on vast amounts of human language data, such as books, articles, and other text-based sources. By analyzing this data, a language model can learn the patterns and structures of language, and use that knowledge to generate text that is similar to what a human might write or say.

In the case of ChatGPT, I was trained on an enormous dataset of text, including books, websites, and other sources, using a technique called "transformer-based language modeling." This means that I can understand and generate text in a variety of different languages and styles, and can adapt to different conversational contexts and topics.  (ChatGPT, 2023-Feb-26)
