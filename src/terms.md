# Terms

Some terms that are common when talking about AI chatbots.

__"What is "Artificial Intelligence"?"__

__"What is "Machine Learning"?"__

__"Where do "Neural Networks" fit into "Machine Learning"?"__

__"rephrase that last answer for a 14-year old."__

- Two notes...
    - we've just shown that ChatGPT has "memory" and a sense of context
    - it's not fully obvious, but we've just scratched the surface of a feature of ChatGPT -- use of "personas", more about that soon after a bit of history.

... and maybe ...

__"enhance that a bit into two or three paragraphs, still for a 14 year old."__

## Relationship between AI & ML &NNs

- A Summary of the relationship of Artificial Intelligence to Machine Learning to Neural Networksâ€¦ One reasonable way to think of this: Neural-networks are a subfield/technique of Machine-Learning; Machine-Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence.
