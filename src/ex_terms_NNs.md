# Terms - NNs

## and how do neural networks fit into this -- again, for a 5th-grader?

Neural networks are a way to make machine learning more powerful. Imagine that you have a big problem, like figuring out if a picture is of a cat or a dog. If you try to solve this problem by writing down a bunch of rules like "if the picture has pointy ears, it's a dog" or "if the picture has whiskers, it's a cat", you might miss some important details and make mistakes.

A neural network, on the other hand, can learn on its own by looking at lots of examples of pictures of cats and dogs, and figuring out what makes them different. It does this by creating a "brain" made up of many simple parts called neurons, which work together to make decisions. When the neural network sees a new picture, it can use what it has learned to make a guess about whether it's a cat or a dog.

So, neural networks are a way to make machine learning more powerful by allowing computers to learn on their own and make more accurate decisions. They are used in many different types of AI, including language models, and are helping to make computers smarter and more useful than ever before!
