# Terms - AI & ML

## in a few paragraphs for a 5th-grader, describe the relationship between artificial intelligence, machine-learning and language-models.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a type of computer program that can help machines do things that normally require human intelligence, like recognizing images, understanding language, and making decisions. One of the ways that AI works is through machine learning, which is a way for computers to learn and improve on their own without being specifically programmed for every task.

Language models are a type of AI that focuses specifically on understanding and generating language. They are trained using huge amounts of text data, which they use to learn the patterns and structures of language. Once a language model is trained, it can be used for a variety of tasks, such as language translation, question answering, and even writing.

So, in summary, machine learning is a way for computers to learn and improve on their own, and language models are a type of AI that use machine learning to understand and generate language. By using machine learning techniques, language models can improve over time and become more accurate and useful for a wide range of applications.
